# Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: 
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing de- vices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a sin- gle BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high through- put content-addressed block storage model, with content- addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block ex- change, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
